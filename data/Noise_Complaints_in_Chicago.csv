AT THIS LOCATION THE DISTINCTODOR OF FOOD WAS ALSO DETECTED, AND THE COMPLAINANT POINTED OUT EXCESSIVE GREASE STAINS ON THE WALL ABOVE THE FAN ( SEE PHOTO ). AT THIS LOCATION, WHICH IS ADJACENT PROPERTY APPROXIMATELY THIRTY (30') FEET AWAY, I PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT TEN (10) CONTINUOUS MINUTES OF CALIBRATED SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL TESTING WHICH RESULTED IN A MEASUREMENT OF 82DBA.


AFTERWARDS THE COMPLAINANT ESCORTED ME TO HIS RESIDENCE, WHERE I WAS ABLE TO DETECT THE SAME NOISE IN QUESTION WHILE POSITIONED INSIDE HIS BEDROOM AT AN OPEN WINDOW (65DBA)


THIS INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE NOISE IN QUESTION IS IN VIOLATION OF CITY ORDINANCE 11-4-2810. THE NEXT SCHEDULED COURT DATE WOULD BE FEBRUARY 16, 2012. I EXPLAINED TO THE COMPLAINANT THAT DOE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING TO ANOTHER CITY DEPARTMENT, AND THAT DUE TO MY RETIREMENT IN JANUARY 2012, IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS VIOLATION WOULD PROCEED.


I INFORMED COMPLAINANT THAT I WOULD SPEAK WITH SUPERVISORS REGARDING THIS COMPLAINT.

AFTER TESTING, I REVIEWED CITY NOISE ORDINANCE WITH THE OWNER WHO AGREED TO DO THE FOLLOWING TO SUPPRESS NOISE: HAVE THE DOOR PERSON MAKE SURE PATRONS DO NOT HOLD ENTRANCE DOOR OPEN LONGER THAN NECESSARY TO ENTER/EXIT, PLACE A SIGN TO NOT RAISE THE VOLUME ON MUSIC EQUIPMENT, RE-DIRECT SPEAKERS TO FACE WEST AWAY FROM THE DOOR, CONTINUE DECIBEL TESTING DURING KARAOKE PERFORMANCES.


NOTE: DURING THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, I WAS APPROACHED BY A PERSON WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS THE COMPLAINANT WHO SMELLED OF ALCOHOL AND APPEARED TO BE INTOXICATED.

AS SCHEDULED, I ARRIVED AND MET WITH COMPLAINANT AT HIS RESIDENTIAL HIGH RISE BUILDING.

AT THIS LOCATION THE DISTINCTODOR OF FOOD WAS ALSO DETECTED, AND THE COMPLAINANT POINTED OUT EXCESSIVE GREASE STAINS ON THE WALL ABOVE THE FAN ( SEE PHOTO ). AT THIS LOCATION, WHICH IS ADJACENT PROPERTY APPROXIMATELY THIRTY (30') FEET AWAY, I PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT TEN (10) CONTINUOUS MINUTES OF CALIBRATED SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL TESTING WHICH RESULTED IN A MEASUREMENT OF 82DBA.


AFTERWARDS THE COMPLAINANT ESCORTED ME TO HIS RESIDENCE, WHERE I WAS ABLE TO DETECT THE SAME NOISE IN QUESTION WHILE POSITIONED INSIDE HIS BEDROOM AT AN OPEN WINDOW (65DBA)


THIS INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE NOISE IN QUESTION IS IN VIOLATION OF CITY ORDINANCE 11-4-2810. THE NEXT SCHEDULED COURT DATE WOULD BE FEBRUARY 16, 2012. I EXPLAINED TO THE COMPLAINANT THAT DOE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING TO ANOTHER CITY DEPARTMENT, AND THAT DUE TO MY RETIREMENT IN JANUARY 2012, IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS VIOLATION WOULD PROCEED.


I INFORMED COMPLAINANT THAT I WOULD SPEAK WITH SUPERVISORS REGARDING THIS COMPLAINT.

UPON ARRIVAL TO SITE I WAS UNABLE TO DETECT ANY LOUD MUSIC OR ACTIVITY EMANATING FROM THIS FACILITY AT 100' FEET AWAY. DURING MY PERIMETER ASSESSMENT, I OBSERVED A PERSON WHO WAS LATER IDENTIFIED AS OWNER TIM SHEPARDSON, (773) 960-5591 USING A PORTABLE DECIBEL METER TO MONITOR NOISE DUE TO A REPORTED NOISE COMPLAINT AND MY PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION.


AT THIS TIME WE BOTH PROCEEDED TO MONITOR AT THE CLOSEST RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN ORDER OF DISTANCE (1303, 1300, AND 1259 W SCHUBERT). TESTING AT ALL THESE LOCATIONS FOUND NOISE ACTIVITY FROM RESPONDENT FACILITY WAS AUDIBLE, BUT LESS THAN 55 DECIBELS AND WITHIN ORDINANCE LIMITS. 


AFTER TESTING, I REVIEWED CITY NOISE ORDINANCE WITH THE OWNER WHO AGREED TO DO THE FOLLOWING TO SUPPRESS NOISE: HAVE THE DOOR PERSON MAKE SURE PATRONS DO NOT HOLD ENTRANCE DOOR OPEN LONGER THAN NECESSARY TO ENTER/EXIT, PLACE A SIGN TO NOT RAISE THE VOLUME ON MUSIC EQUIPMENT, RE-DIRECT SPEAKERS TO FACE WEST AWAY FROM THE DOOR, CONTINUE DECIBEL TESTING DURING KARAOKE PERFORMANCES.


NOTE: DURING THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, I WAS APPROACHED BY A PERSON WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS THE COMPLAINANT WHO SMELLED OF ALCOHOL AND APPEARED TO BE INTOXICATED. WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS, HE MADE SEVERAL DEROGATORY AND INSULTING COMMENTS ABOUT THE WAY I WAS CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION. HE ASKED MY NAME AND RECORDED MY MARKED VEHICLE INFORMATION AND ASKED TO SPEAK WITH MY SUPERVISOR. AT THIS TIME I PHONED DOE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER KEVIN SCHNOES WHO WAS NOTIFIED OF THE CONFRONTATIONAL COMPLAINANT.


AFTER SPEAKING WITH DEPUTY COMMISSIONER SCHNOES, I CONTINUED TO CONDUCT EXTENDED NOISE MONITORING PAST 12 MIDNIGHT WHICH FOUND RESPONDENT FACILITY COMPLIANT ON THIS NIGHT.
